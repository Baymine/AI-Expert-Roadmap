// 核心 accept 方法\n}\n```\n\n**2. 具体元素 (`Circle`, `Square`)**\n\n```java\nclass Circle implements Shape {\n    private double radius;\n\n    public Circle(double radius) {\n        this.radius = radius;\n    }\n\n    public double getRadius() {\n        return radius;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void accept(ShapeVisitor visitor) {\n        visitor.visit(this); // 调用访问者的 Circle 方法\n    }\n}\n\nclass Square implements Shape {\n    private double side;\n\n    public Square(double side) {\n        this.side = side;\n    }\n\n    public double getSide() {\n        return side;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void accept(ShapeVisitor visitor) {\n        visitor.visit(this); // 调用访问者的 Square 方法\n    }\n}\n\n// 让我们添加另一个用于说明\nclass Rectangle implements Shape {\n    private double width;\n    private double height;\n\n    public Rectangle(double width, double height) {\n        this.width = width;\n        this.height = height;\n    }\n\n     public double getWidth() { return width; }\n     public double getHeight() { return height; }\n\n    @Override\n    public void accept(ShapeVisitor visitor) {\n        visitor.visit(this); // 调用访问者的 Rectangle 方法\n    }\n}\n```\n\n*注意：`Circle`、`Square`、`Rectangle` 只知道它们的数据和 `accept` 方法。 这里没有计算逻辑。*\n\n**3. 访问者接口 (`ShapeVisitor`)**\n\n```java\ninterface ShapeVisitor {\n    void visit(Circle circle);     // Circle 的方法\n    void visit(Square square);     // Square 的方法\n    void visit(Rectangle rectangle); // Rectangle 的方法\n    // 如果您添加更多形状类型，请添加更多 visit 方法\n}\n```\n\n*此接口定义了*可以*执行哪些操作，特定于每种形状类型。*\n\n**4. 具体访问者（操作）**\n\n```java\n// 用于计算面积的访问者\nclass AreaCalculatorVisitor implements ShapeVisitor {\n    private double totalArea = 0;\n\n    @Override\n    public void visit(Circle circle) {\n        double area = Math.PI * circle.getRadius() * circle.getRadius();\n        System.out.printf(\"Calculating area for Circle: %.2f%n\", area);\n        totalArea += area;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void visit(Square square) {\n        double area = square.getSide() * square.getSide();\n        System.out.printf(\"Calculating area for Square: %.2f%n\", area);\n        totalArea += area;\n    }\n\n     @Override\n    public void visit(Rectangle rectangle) {\n        double area = rectangle.getWidth() * rectangle.getHeight();\n        System.out.printf(\"Calculating area for Rectangle: %.2f%n\", area);\n        totalArea += area;\n    }\n\n    public double getTotalArea() {\n        return totalArea;\n    }\n}\n\n// 用于计算周长的访问者\nclass PerimeterCalculatorVisitor implements ShapeVisitor {\n     private double totalPerimeter = 0;\n\n    @Override\n    public void visit(Circle circle) {\n        double perimeter = 2 * Math.PI * circle.getRadius();\n         System.out.printf(\"Calculating perimeter for Circle: %.2f%n\", perimeter);\n        totalPerimeter += perimeter;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void visit(Square square) {\n       double perimeter = 4 * square.getSide();\n       System.out.printf(\"Calculating perimeter for Square: %.2f%n\", perimeter);\n       totalPerimeter += perimeter;\n    }\n\n     @Override\n    public void visit(Rectangle rectangle) {\n       double perimeter = 2 * (rectangle.getWidth() + rectangle.getHeight());\n       System.out.printf(\"Calculating perimeter for Rectangle: %.2f%n\", perimeter);\n       totalPerimeter += perimeter;\n    }\n\n    public double getTotalPerimeter() {\n        return totalPerimeter;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n*注意：所有面积逻辑都整齐地包含在 `AreaCalculatorVisitor` 中，而周长逻辑包含在 `PerimeterCalculatorVisitor` 中。*\n\n**5. 使用访问者**\n\n```java\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\nimport java.util.List;\n\npublic class VisitorDemo {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        List<Shape> shapes = new ArrayList<>();\n        shapes.add(new Circle(5));\n        shapes.add(new Square(4));\n        shapes.add(new Rectangle(3, 6));\n        shapes.add(new Circle(2.5));\n\n        System.out.println(\"--- Calculating Areas ---\");\n        AreaCalculatorVisitor areaVisitor = new AreaCalculatorVisitor();\n        for (Shape shape : shapes) {\n            shape.accept(areaVisitor); // 魔力发生在这里！\n        }\n        System.out.printf(\"Total Area: %.2f%n%n\", areaVisitor.getTotalArea());\n\n\n        System.out.println(\"--- Calculating Perimeters ---\");\n        PerimeterCalculatorVisitor perimeterVisitor = new PerimeterCalculatorVisitor();\n         for (Shape shape : shapes) {\n            shape.accept(perimeterVisitor); // 对不同的操作使用不同的访问者\n        }\n        System.out.printf(\"Total Perimeter: %.2f%n\", perimeterVisitor.getTotalPerimeter());\n\n        // *** 如果我们想要一个新的操作怎么办？ 例如，绘制形状？ ***\n        // 我们只需创建一个新的访问者类 'DrawingVisitor'\n        // 我们不需要触摸 Shape、Circle、Square 或 Rectangle！\n        // （DrawingVisitor 的示例尚未完全实现，只是为了展示这个想法）\n        /*\n        class DrawingVisitor implements ShapeVisitor {\n             @Override public void visit(Circle c) { System.out.println(\"Drawing a circle with radius \" + c.getRadius()); }\n             @Override public void visit(Square s) { System.out.println(\"Drawing a square with side \" + s.getSide()); }\n             @Override public void visit(Rectangle r) { System.out.println(\"Drawing a rectangle \" + r.getWidth() + \"x\" + r.getHeight());

            "text/markdown": "这是一个非常有见地的观察！ 您发现相似之处是对的，因为这两种模式都涉及一种形式的**解耦**和**传递行为**。 让我们分解一下这种关系：\n\n**相似之处：**\n\n1.  **解耦：** 这两种模式都将 \"调用者\" 与 \"操作\" 的特定实现解耦。\n    *   **访问者：** 元素（`Circle`、`Square`）与特定操作（`AreaCalculatorVisitor`、`PerimeterCalculatorVisitor`）解耦。 元素只知道它需要 `accept` *某个* 访问者。\n    *   **回调：** 触发事件的代码（例如，一个按钮）与处理事件的特定代码（回调函数/方法）解耦。 按钮只知道它需要调用 *某个* 已注册的监听器的方法。\n2.  **传递行为：** 两者都涉及传递一个代表操作或行为的对象。\n    *   **访问者：** 您将一个 `Visitor` 对象（其中包含操作逻辑）传递给 `accept` 方法。\n    *   **回调：** 您将一个函数引用、lambda 或实现监听器接口的对象（其中包含处理逻辑）传递给事件源（例如，`button.addActionListener(myCallbackObject)`）。\n3.  **控制反转：** 两者都表现出控制反转。 主对象不是直接调用方法来执行操作，而是调用一个方法（`accept` 或触发方法），该方法 *反过来* 调用传递的行为（`visit` 方法或回调方法）。\n\n**主要区别（为什么访问者更具体）：**\n\n1.  **目的和结构：**\n    *   **访问者：** 专门设计用于向*现有的类层次结构*添加*新的操作*，而无需修改这些类。 它本质上处理基于它访问的元素的*类型*以不同方式运行。 核心机制依赖于*双重分派*（`accept` 调用 `visit`）。\n    *   **回调：** 一种用于延迟执行、事件处理或异步操作的更通用的机制。 它本质上并不处理以相同的结构化方式遍历复杂的对象结构或基于层次结构中多个类类型的不同行为。 通常，只有一个回调方法（例如 `run()` 或 `actionPerformed()`）。\n2.  **处理类型：**\n    *   **访问者：** `Visitor` 接口显式地为每种具体的元素类型定义不同的 `visit` 方法（`visit(Circle)`、`visit(Square)`）。 这对于模式至关重要 - 基于元素的类型选择正确的操作，*而无需* 在主循环中使用 `if/else` 或 `instanceof`。\n    *   **回调：** 回调通常具有单一的方法签名。 虽然回调的*实现*可以检查类型或接收上下文，但基本回调机制本身主要不是以与访问者相同的方式区分它可能操作的不同类型的对象。\n3.  **\"遍历\" 的对象：**\n    *   **访问者：** `accept` 方法在*元素本身*上调用，并且元素将 `this` 传递给访问者。 元素主动参与选择正确的 `visit` 方法。\n    *   **回调：** 回调通常由事件源或框架调用，可能会将事件数据或源对象*作为参数*传递给回调方法。 正在操作的对象通常没有特定于回调模式的 `accept` 类方法。\n\n**类比：**\n\n*   **回调：** 想象一下将您的电话号码（回调）交给某人。 当发生某事（事件）时，他们会回拨 *您*。 当被调用时，您执行 *您的* 特定操作。\n*   **访问者：** 想象一下，一个专业的技师（访问者）访问工厂中的不同部门（像 `Circle`、`Square` 这样的元素）。 每个部门都有一个标准程序 (`accept`) 来欢迎技师。 当技师到达时，部门会指导他们（`accept` 调用 `visit`），并且技师执行他们接受过培训的 *特定任务* *在那个特定的部门*（`visit(DepartmentA)`、`visit(DepartmentB)`）。 如果您需要完成*不同的*任务（例如，安全检查而不是维护），您需要发送*不同的*技师（一个不同的访问者）。\n\n**结论：**\n\n虽然访问者 *使用* 一种感觉有点像回调（传递行为并调用它）的机制，但访问者模式是为解决向类层次结构添加操作的问题量身定制的更专业的解决方案。 它提供了一种结构化的方式（通过 `accept`/`visit` 和双重分派）来处理基于在该层次结构中操作的对象的类型在行为上的变化。\n\n您对相似之处的直觉很好 - 这表明您正在认识到像解耦这样的基本原则！ 但是访问者模式在一般的回调想法之上添加了一个特定的结构和目的。\n"
